# Mori Calliope – Rivals and Equals

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Base instincts take control
Like primal ways of a warrior
Is it glory you're after, like me?
Underestimated everywhere I turn
Taking aim but it doesn't make a difference at
all
I got a million different enemies I cannot
recall
You're rocking up to a battle when you know that
you'll fall
Hidden motivation, watch it all burn
I gotta tell you
I never liked you
Now would I lie to you?
Let me ignite you
When thunder crashes down
When the world caves under my pressure
There'll be no one to save
Where is your pride, your human will to survive?
Was it just
Empty words for your grave?
I reach inside this soul
Now all that remains
Is delusion and decay
Cuz of you, I live this way
We're not rivals
We're not equals
We're not rivals
You're just confused
Lightning never strikes twice in the same spot
So go ahead and run up on me till you get your
shot
I see the weapon that you're hiding, come on
ready or not
Another life and you would never give a second
thought
Thinkin' your pride's different than mine
Ticking all your vital signs off
But we still gotta
Protect all our friends from our enemies
Wouldn't you agree?
Forged in fires of hell
God can't betray you
If I'm a fallen angel
What does that make you?
I'm not debasing myself
To see the same view
When it's your pride on the line
No one can save you from mine
We're not rivals
We're not equals
We're not rivals
We're not equals
